        <p class="paragraph-2">David began his yoga journey in 1973 at San Diego State University, enrolling in their first yoga class offered to students. &quot;I figured if The Beatles thought it was cool, it had to be worth checking out.&quot; He recalls sitting in closing meditation; &quot;This is the most amazing thing I have ever experienced, I would love to share this!&quot;
          <br><br> Fast forward 30 years of yoga classes anywhere and everywhere he lived and traveled, David found himself on the Big Island of Hawaii retired from a career in software development and wondering where his life would go next. Nearing the completion of his apprenticeship as a Licensed Massage Therapist he was offered an opportunity to enroll in a 140 hour Yoga Teacher training intensive. &quot;Since my basic approach to life is to just say &#x27;YES&#x27;, I did!&quot;
          <br><br> David completed his first teacher training in 2002 under the direction of Kathy Elder, career yoga teacher and student of both BKS Iyengar and Sri Pattabi Joyce. Living and working at Kalani Eco Retreat on the Big Island gave David the opportunity to begin teaching right away, offering weekly Hatha and Yin yoga classes to local residents and guests of the resort.</p>

        <p class="p-2 w-clearfix">&quot;There is no part of my life that has not been touched by yoga philosophy and practice. I attribute astounding physical, mental and emotional health and well-being to my lifelong devotion to the art and science of yoga. I owe my life to the teachers that have come before me.&quot;<br><br>David was invited to participate in CorePower&#x27;s Teacher Training Intensive in late 2011, and was on the opening team at their Honolulu location in Kahala. He also completed CorePower&#x27;s 200 hour Yoga Teacher training in 2012 and has assisted at several teacher trainings and extension programs. David teaches and practices from a place of joy and excitement; &quot;When we approach life with an open heart and enthusiasm all good things flow our way.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wanted to take a moment out to thank you very much for the most incredible massage experience. Without a doubt, my time spent with you was not only healing but remarkable in every way.   Thank you for giving so much of yourself. I truly hope that our paths cross one day soon again.&quot;<br>
